# RepoLint
A program to lint (find problems) files submitted to the [KtaneContent](https://github.com/Timwi/KtaneContent) repo.

## Usage
```
RepoLint <path>
```
If `path` points to a directory, it'll be linted like it's a copy of the KtaneContent repo. If `path` points to a file, it'll extract and lint that zip file.
